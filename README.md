# Final-Project
Naloxone Access & Opioid Overdose Burden in NYC

# Overview

This project examines borough-level opioid overdose burden in New York City and compares it with naloxone access (as a proxy: programs per 100k residents). The analysis produces tidy datasets, descriptive graphics, an interactive map, and a presentation that summarizes findings and recommendations for resource allocation.

# Key takeaway:
In the 2022 snapshot, the Bronx shows the highest overdose death rate (~55.1 per 100k; 762 deaths), while Manhattan exhibits the highest naloxone access (~4.0 per 100k) with a moderate overdose burden (~26.1). Queens shows both lower burden (~19.8) and comparatively low access (~1.6). With only three borough observations in this snapshot, simple correlations are not statistically significant, but geographic disparities are clear and policy-relevant.
Data Sources

NY State Opioid Dashboard (exported CSV; indicators include crude overdose death rates):

Columns used: Component Area, Indicator, Year, County/Region, Numerator, Rate, etc.

Borough Population – Standard NYC borough populations (used to compute programs per 100k).

Naloxone Access (Proxy) – Illustrative borough counts of naloxone programs; converted to a per-100k measure to compare across populations.

Note: This analysis focuses on a 2022 snapshot for three boroughs (Bronx, Manhattan, Queens) due to data availability in the exported slice. “NYC TOTAL” is excluded from borough aggregations.
Interpretation

Geographic disparities are evident: Bronx’s overdose burden is far higher than Manhattan/Queens.

Access paradox: Higher access in Manhattan does not map cleanly to lower burden; Queens shows low burden & low access. With limited observations, causal inference is not possible—but patterns can still guide targeted resource allocation.

Actionable steps:

Bronx: expand treatment on demand, harm reduction services, and address social determinants.

Queens: increase proactive naloxone distribution to prevent future spikes.

Citywide: extend the time horizon and borough coverage; evaluate intervention placement with stronger study designs.
